  ### A practical insight into the bewildering stupidity of TypeScript enums
</span>

## The appeal of enums

On paper, enums allow you to define a constrained set of named constants. This provides type safety, useful editor feedback, and intellisense.

```ts
enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue,
}

const myFunc = (color?: Color) => {
  if (color) {
    console.log("I received a color");
  } else {
    console.log("No color received");
  }
};
```

Seems innocent enough. Until you try calling `myFunc` with `Color.Red`:

```ts
myFunc(Color.Red);

> "No color received"
```

Hmmmmm... ???

## Enums at runtime

So when a developer is confronted with something as seemingly absurd as this, their natural instinct would likely be to try to log the value of the color argument.

```ts
const myFunc = (color?: Color) => {
  console.log(color);
};
```

Anticipation building...

```ts
myFunc(Color.Red);

> 0
```

"Ok I don't know what I was expecting but it certainly wasn't that."

What's the next logical step? Log the entire enum:

```ts
console.log(Color);

> { '0': 'Red', '1': 'Green', '2': 'Blue', Red: 0, Green: 1, Blue: 2 }
```

Fascinating... This raises more questions than answers but at least you'll now understand why `myFunc(Color.Red)` didn't work. It's because `Color.Red` is falsy when evaluated as a boolean. In fact, the first entry in any enum will always evaluate as falsy.
