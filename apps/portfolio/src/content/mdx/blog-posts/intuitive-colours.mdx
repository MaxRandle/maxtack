## Forget everything you know about colour

Or at least how computers represent colour. In order to understand why this approach works, you need to completely shift your perspective on the concept of what a colour is.

### RGB, hex, and HSL do not actually represent colours.

This is the first revelation to wrap your head around. RGB (and by extension hex and HSL) is a representation of the state of a piece of hardware. It is an instruction to be given to a pixel that tells it how much of red, green, and blue light it should emit. It is not tied to a real-world concept of a colour.

## The LAB colour space

Unlike the sRGB colour space, The LAB colour space does not the represent hardware capabilities or even the physical properties of light. Instead it represents human perception of colour.

LAB is a cylindrical colour space with three axes:

- L: Lightness
- A: Green to red
- B: Blue to yellow

These components can be thought of as cartesian coordinates used to navigate a 3D cylindrical colour space.

### LAB is designed to be perceptually uniform

Each property is completely independent of the others.

### LAB is not intuitive to work with.

In general, humans are not very good at working with cartesian co-ordinates in the real world. We are much better at intuitively grasping polar co-ordinates.

## Introducing LCH

LCH is the ultimate way to numerically represent a colour.

It is simply a way to navigate the LAB colour space using polar co-ordinates. It too has 3 axes:

### Lightness (L)

This does NOT represent luminosity or brightness. Remember the LAB colour space has no relevance to the physical properties of light. It represents how "light" a colour is appears. This ranges between 0 and 100, with 0 being black and 100 being white.

### chroma (C)

This represents how strongly a colour is expressed, it can also be thought of as saturation. This property starts at 0 and is unbounded.

### Hue (H)

Hue represents the angle around the colour wheel. This property starts at 0 and is unbounded.

## OKLCH - an implementation of LCH in CSS

OKLCH is an actual implementation of the LCH specification that can be used right now with a postcss plugin.

```css
background-color: oklch(50% 100 0deg);
```

## Introducing the OKLCH colour palette generator

with this we can generate out colour palette using OKLCH and represent it using hex or RGB.

## Most devices are still limited to sRGB

By using oklch in our css, we're specifying what colour we want, and allowing physical devices to attempt to reproduce that colour as faithfully as possible withing the constraints of their hardware. But what if the device only supports sRGB?

## fallback colours

Oklch implements an approach to calculating an sRGB fallback for colours that transcend sRGB. The chroma is reduced until the colour is within the sRGB colour space. This means that in the worst case scenario, the colour will be desaturated, but it will still have the same hue and lightness. Meaning that there is no risk of accessibility issues.

## We can still make use of the power of OKLCH without actually using it

This is the best part. We can generate our colour palette using the OKLCH colour picker, and while doing so we ensure that our colours also fall within the sRGB colour space. We can then use the generated hex or RGB values in our css.

This has all the benefits of using OKLCH directly, the only downside being that we sacrifice vibrant colours on devices that might support extended colour spaces.
