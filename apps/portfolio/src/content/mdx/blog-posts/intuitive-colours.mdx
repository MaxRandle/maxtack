# Intuitive colours

In this blog I will explain a simple and intuitive approach for generating a colour palette that produces stunning and incredibly visually consistent results.

## Forget everything you know about colour

Or at least how computers represent colour. In order to understand why this approach works, you need to completely shift your perspective on the concept of what a colour is.

### RGB, hex, and HSL do not actually represent colours.

RGB (and by extension hex and HSL) is a representation of the state of a piece of hardware. It is an instruction to be given to a pixel that tells it how much of red, green, and blue light it should emit.

## The LAB colour space

Unlike RGB, The LAB colour space does not the represent hardware or even the physical properties of light. Instead it represents how humans perceive colours.

LAB represents a cylindrical colour space. It has three components:

- L: Lightness
- A: Green to red
- B: Blue to yellow

These components can be thought of as cartesian coordinates used to navigate a 3D cylindrical colour space.

### LAB is designed to be perceptually uniform

Each property is completely independent of the others.

## LAB is not intuitive to work with.

Humans are much better at intuitively grasping polar co-ordinates.

## Introducing LCH

LCH is a polar representation of the LAB colour space. It defines a specification for how to represent a colour using the following components:

| Component       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| L _(lightness)_ | This does NOT represent luminosity or brightness. Remember LCH does not represent physical properties of light. It represents how "light" a colour is appears. This ranges between 0 and 100, with 0 being black and 100 being white. |
| C _(chroma)_    | This represents how much a colour is expressed, it can also be thought of as saturation. This property starts at 0 and is unbounded.                                                                                                  |
| H _(hue)_       | This represents the angle around the colour wheel. This property starts at 0 and is unbounded.                                                                                                                                        |

## Introducing OKLCH

OKLCH is an actual implementation of the LCH specification that we can use right now with a postcss plugin.

```css
background-color: oklch(50% 100 0deg);
```

OKLCH is the ultimate way to numerically represent a colour.

## Most devices are still limited to sRGB

## We can still make use of the power of OKLCH without actually using it

## Introducing the OKLCH colour palette generator

with this we can generate out colour palette using OKLCH and represent it using hex or RGB.
